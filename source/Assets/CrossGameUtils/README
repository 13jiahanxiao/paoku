This repository is meant to be a collection of utilities that would be useful across multiple Unity game projects.
It is meant to reside somewhere under <Unity dir>/Assets.

For installing this into your own unity project, use the following command (assuming you're somewhere under <Unity dir>).  
git subtree add --prefix=Assets/CrossGameUtils git@github.wdig.com:URBIR003/CrossGameUtils.git master

To push changes into this CrossGameUtils repository from your Game specific project, use
git subtree push --prefix=Assets/CrossGameUtils git@github.wdig.com:URBIR003/CrossGameUtils.git master

For more info on git subtree, take a look at 
http://psionides.eu/2010/02/04/sharing-code-between-projects-with-git-subtree/
http://apenwarr.ca/log/?m=200904
I placed a copy of git-subtree in 
raven.wdig.com//BYTESIZED/GettingStarted/InstallingPrograms/git-subtree

When making commits, it is best to separate commits into the CrossGameUtils directory from the rest of your project.

Finally since it's meant to be used across different projects, please do not break backwards compatibility.  If you do really need to break it talk to Redmond first.  

Most importantly, do NOT put game specific files in here. 

(minor change to test forked repos picking up from source repo changes)
